## Microcorruption Level - New Orleans

The first level on the Microcorruption CTF is the New Orleans level.

We need to find out the password in order to unlock the vault and solve the puzzle.
Lets start by looking at the main function which the program starts at:

We can see a function called "check_password" which seems the most interesting one so should set a breakpoint for that function and step through it to see if we have anything interesting in the registers or memory (which in the best case scenario would have the password).

To get to that function, let's just enter a bogus password. I have entered "password" as my password to get to that function:![Screenshot from 2020-03-12 11-29-21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/new_orleans/Screenshot from 2020-03-12 11-29-21.png)

We can also see that in the register "R15", it contains the memory address for the password that I have entered

Stepping through the function, we move the memory address from r15 to r13 and we keep stepping until we come across a very interesting instruction 

		cmp.b	@r13, 0x2400(r14)

This instruction compares the first byte (hence the name cmp.b) between the value stored in r13 and the value of r14 + the offset of 0x2400. Because the memory address in r14 is 0x0000, the value of it will be 0x2400.

We run the command:

		r 2400

to see what is inside the memory address of 0x2400 and we get this VERY interesting data from the memory:

And the cmp.b is comparing the first byte which is 6c (in hex) or in ASCII, is "l".

Which means this instruction is checking whether the first character of the password we inputted is the character "l".

The next couple instructions are just extra checks based on the password that we have given but let's go back to the memory address 0x2400. This is probably the password that was stored in the memory which the program compares to your password and if it is the same then it will (obviously) let us in.

So lets try that. The value stored in the memory address 0x2400 is "l?0+r+w" in ASCII or "6c3f 302b 722b 77" in hex.

The program allows us to send inputs in hex so send the input as the hex code (or ASCII, it doesn't matter) and see if the program lets us in.

And now we have solved and unlocked the lock, so we can type in "solve", enter this password and unlock and finish the level.
